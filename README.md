# Obsidian Tasks (Modified)

### Please look at [Obsidian Tasks Readme](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/README.md) to understand the functionality of this plugin

## Usage

To use this mod, download the [latest release zip](https://github.com/ViscousPotential/obsidian-tasks-calendar-emoji-mod/releases) and put the folder within the archive into your vaults' `.obsidian/plugins` folder (so `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-tasks-calendar-emoji-mod`)

**Make sure to REMOVE the original `obsidian-tasks` plugin as they will conflict**

## Modifications

This is a fork of the Obsidian Tasks Plugin, adding custom calendar emojis for due dates in short mode.
